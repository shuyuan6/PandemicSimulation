# PandemicSimulation
This project uses Java to simulate pandemic model and generate epidemic curve that shows the frequency of new cases and deaths over time based on JavaFX, the shape of the curve differs in relation to specific factors during the pandemic.


This image shows that the count of the patients increased rapidly at the very early stage, the epidemic curve is like exponential growth.

As the time goes by, the epidemic curve reaches the peak, and go in into a short plateau period, the count of deaths emerges and increases.
